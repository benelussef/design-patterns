# design-patterns
1- Factory design pattern:
- The Factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows you to delegate the responsibility of object instantiation to subclasses or other specialized classes
- This pattern is useful when you want to create objects that have a common interface but may be of different types or require different initialization logic. By using a factory, you can centralize the creation logic and avoid the need to directly instantiate objects using constructors.
- Use Cases:
    + When you want to create objects with a common interface but vary their types or configurations.
    + When you want to centralize object creation logic to avoid code duplication.
    + When you want to decouple the client code from the concrete classes it uses.
