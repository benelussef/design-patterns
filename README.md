1- Design Pattern Strategy

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows a client to choose the appropriate algorithm from a family of algorithms at runtime, without altering the code that uses them. It promotes flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility by separating the algorithms from the client code.
